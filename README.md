# Machine Vision

Machine Vision is a web application that allows you to upload an image in PNG or JPEG format and perform object detection on it using computer vision techniques. The application uses the object detection API to detect objects in the uploaded image and displays the results in a table along with the count of each object. The application also displays the uploaded image with bounding boxes around the detected objects.
